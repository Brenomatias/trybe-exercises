                &emsp;Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods (<em>Odontodactylus scyllarus</em>), are carnivorous 
                marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda branching from other members of the class 
                Malacostraca around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 
                10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in.A mantis shrimp's 
                carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers
                only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range 
                in color from shades of brown to vivid colors, with more than 450 species of mantis shrimps 
                being known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and 
                subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, 
                as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes.
                The stomatopods belongs to Phylum Anthropoda, Subphylum Crustacea,Class Malacostraca 
                and the Order Stomatopoda.

            <h5>&emsp;Physical characteristics</h5>
            <p class="paragrah">
                &emsp;A typical mantis shrimp looks, at first glance, like an elaborated, elongated shrimp,
               with stalked eyes and, according to species, may sport brilliant splashes or coats of 
               garish colors, or may be more cryptically colored. Colors vary considerably among and 
               within species, and between sexes. The body may be cylindrical or somewhat flattened 
               dorsoventrally. The thorax is shield-shaped and the abdomen is conspicuously segmented. 
               At the front of the head, moveable somites bear the eyes and double antennae. The prominent, 
               stalked eyes are often vividly colored iridescent emerald, ruby, or sapphire.
            </p>
            <p class="paragrah">
                &emsp;Eight pairs of limbs arise from the thorax. The front-most five limb pairs, the maxillipeds, 
               are manipulatory, used in hunting and feeding; the second pair comprises the deadly raptorial 
               appendages, the stomatopods' most conspicuous claim to fame. Behind the raptorials are three 
               more pairs of maxillipeds, then three pairs of walking limbs, or pereaopods. The abdomen bears 
               five pairs of swimming limbs, the pleopods, which also bear the gills, and ends in an enlarged, 
               fanlike tail, made up of the shieldlike telson, flanked by a pair of uropods, or tail appendages.
                Stomatopoda ("stomach-mouth") alludes to the first five pairs of thoracic limbs, since these are used in feeding.

            <h6> &emsp;The most powerful punch in the nature</h6>
            <p class="paragrah">
                &emsp;If threatened,the peacock mantis shrimp can whip out these appendages at speeds of 23 m/sec (75 ft/sec). 
                That's 50 times faster than the blink of an eye, or about the same as the trajectory of a .22 calibre bullet 
                and with a force some 100 times that of its weight, making it the strongest self-powered strike by an animal. 
                There are 400-plus species of mantis shrimp. Some, known as "spearers", have front legs topped with spear-like 
                barbs with which they stab or snag soft-bellied prey, such as fish. Others, like the peacock mantis shrimp,
                are "smashers", equipped with hammer-like clubs that they use to batter and bludgeon shellfish and crustacean.
                So rapid is the uncoiling of their deadly limbs that it generates vapour-filled bubbles between the limb and 
                the animal it is about to hit. That effectively doubles the impact of the strike: after the club makes 
                contact with its target, the bubbles collapse and unleash a shock wave that may stun or kill the prey 
                (sometimes even if the blow misses altogether!).
