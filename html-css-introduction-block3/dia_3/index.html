     <p> Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate salt water throughout the world, <br>
         from about 45째S to 45째N.[7] They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, <br>
         coral reefs, and mangroves. Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to <br>
         South America. In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, <br>
         known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.<br>
         Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary. <br>
        Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), <br>
        H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse), and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species <br>
        form territories; males stay within 1 m2 (10 sq ft) of habitat, while females range over about one hundred times that.</p>
