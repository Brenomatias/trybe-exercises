When you encounter an error saying ‘ReactDOM’ is not defined, it means that your application is can’t find the variable 
ReactDOM because it hasn’t been initialized yet.
Most likely, you forgot to import it from the package react-dom:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

***** depois que usar comando npx creat-react-app name
nmp install
npm start
